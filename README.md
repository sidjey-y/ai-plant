# A-I Plant - AI-Powered Agriculture Monitoring System 

![Dashboard](readme_images/Dashboard.png)

## Overview

A-I Plant is an intelligent agriculture monitoring system that leverages artificial intelligence to provide real-time soil analysis, nutrient monitoring, and farming recommendations. The platform helps farmers optimize their agricultural practices by offering detailed insights into soil quality, moisture levels, pH balance, and nutrient content across multiple fields.

While A-I Plant integrates machine learning models for soil quality prediction and recommendation generation, much of the current functionality operates as a simulation to demonstrate the intended AI capabilities. Full integration with live sensor data and real-time AI-driven analysis is planned for future development.

## Key Features
